# Carolyn Stevens

Hi, I'm Carolyn.

I am an ex-professional super-yacht sailor, on a new adventure - learning to code! 

After more than 15 years at sea, I have became fully versed in all things sailing within the Super Yacht industry. I worked onboard both the largest sailing yacht in the world and the largest sailing catamaran as an Officer and the onboard sailing expert. During my time working at sea I progressed through the ranks, gaining the highest certification available within the industry - the illustrious 'Master 3000'.

While working onboard one extremly large yacht, with a semi-automated sailing system, I became increasingly facinated with the programming and logic behind the automation. So much so that I have decided to take the leap, move back to land and dive a diferent and new world - striving to become a professional a programer and developer!

Over the past year I have immersed myself within Harvard's CS50 courses, completing CS50x, CS50's Web development with Python and Javascript, and most recently CS50's AI with Python.

I am looking to join a team to progress in my developing career.
