- Hi, I’m @SailorGirl1234
- 
- I am on a mission to learn to dode in order to start a new career as a developer.
- I am currently studying Harvard's CS50x and am thoroughly enjoying the challenge. 
- So far I have been coding in C, Python 3 and SQLite 3.

- I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could use some beginner coding help, with some interesting logic challenges.
