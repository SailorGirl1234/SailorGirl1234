## **Hi, I'm Carolyn.**

I am an ex-professional super-yacht sailor, on a new adventure - launching a new career as a developer! 

After more than 12 years at sea, I became fully versed in all things sailing within the Super Yacht industry. I worked onboard both the largest sailing yacht in the world and the largest sailing catamaran as Officer and the onboard sailing expert. During my time working at sea I progressed through the ranks, gaining the highest certification available - the illustrious 'Master 3000'.

While working onboard one extremly large yacht, with a semi-automated sailing system, I became increasingly facinated with the programming and logic behind the automation. So much so that I have decided to take the leap, move back to land and dive a diferent and new world - striving to become a professional software engineer!

Over the past 18+ months I have immersed myself within Harvard's CS50 courses, completing CS50x, CS50's Web development with Python and Javascript, and most recently CS50's AI with Python.

I am now looking to join a team with a real purpose to progress in my developing career.

## Check out some of my projects

Due to Harvard's Academic Honesty Policy, most of my projects are in private repositories. If you would like to take a look, just let me know!

I used TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. I used the labeled dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.

By combining various layers and filters I was able to create a neural network that's models showed consistantly reliable accuracy of around 0.985 with a loss of around 0.05.

VR Polars is designed to be used as a reference tool whilst playing the Virtual Regatta Offshore sailing racing game. It shows the user what boat speed is expected, and which sail is best to use, given a certain wind speed and direction.
